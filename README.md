[RGB.fun](https://rgb.fun/) allows users to mint 5x5 black and white grids generated from a RGB code they picked.  
Unfortunately, the website doesn't allow to mint an RGB code that corresponds to a grid you want, it is only from RGB to grid.  

This little project allows frustrated users and opportunists to draw on a 5x5 grid, get the resulting RGB code and mint it. Making it easier to get a drawing you like.

**Note :** This was the first project I ever built entirely with AI (Cursor Composer + Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The `.cursorrules` file and the `prompts` folder served as guidelines for the development.
